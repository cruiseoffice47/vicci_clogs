So in order to secure your cruise and generate a confirmation code, you simply need to secure the government port taxes and fees of only $198 per person for a total of only $396 today.</p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-style:italic;">So to secure your port taxes and fees, would you like to use a visa, mastercard, discover, or american express?</span></p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">IF CUSTOMER SAYS NO READ BELOW:</span></p>

<p>Oh, well it‚Äôs your stateroom you‚Äôre entitled to based on the promotion you entered‚Ä¶. And in that promotion there‚Äôs only 4 left that are allowed in your state to even give away for free, but let me send you this in writing so you can see it‚Ä¶ will that be ok?</p>

<p>Because it‚Äôs a FANTASTIC cruise vacation that you can use anytime you want in the next 18 months for you and any guest you choose.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Now Mr./Mrs.______________________, this is important. This is an exclusive vacation offer not available to the general public and is offered on a first come, first serve basis because of the discounted price and limited availability.</p>

<p>Now <i>(Customer‚Äôs Name)</i> I‚Äôm sure you can imagine your VIP extended stay vacation is valued at well over $4,950.

The 3 days and 2 nights in Orlando, the upgrade to the 7 day 6 night cruise on the amazing Islander, and the additional 4 days & 3 nights in south Florida that you could even use at another time. Oh yeah, let‚Äôs not forget about the $100 entertainment voucher.</p>

<p>Now you can see why everyone is doing it!!</p>

<p>‚úÖ So you‚Äôre already registered for your cruise, now we can add the $1,674 to the same card that you provided for your port tax or would you prefer to use a different card?</p>
