  <h3>‚ÑπÔ∏è Why the Promotion</h3>
  <p>__________ I'm going to get everything emailed out to you in just a moment but first let me take a moment to explain how and why we are running this very popular FREE Cruise Promotion....</p>
  <p>Our ship sets sail 3 times per week, whether it's half full, part full, or completely full. Since an empty cabin can't spend money in the gift shop or casino we would love to have you on board having a WONDERFUL time. But also what's the first thing you would do when you get back home from your cruise, other than unpack? <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(Let them answer)</span></p>
  <p>Exactly! You'd tell your friends and family all about us and then they would want to travel with us as well!</p>
  <p>Positive word-of-mouth advertising is the best form of advertising out there... you'd agree with that right? <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(get a yes)</span></p>

  <p>(Customer's name) this promotion is based on a first come first serve basis per state, so what state are you coming from? <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(get customer's state)</span></p>
  <p>(Customer‚Äôs name) Let me put you on a brief hold to check to see if we have any free cruise cabins left‚Ä¶ <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(Park call for 5 seconds and come back on extremely excited)</span></p>

  <h3>üìã Free Cruise Details</h3>
  <p>One more thing, __________ __________ I do have to let you know, just to make it fair to the thousands of people who are trying to take advantage of the free cruise promotion and because of the limited availability, we will need to know today if you want to take advantage of the offer, even though you do have a full 18 months to actually take the cruise, fair enough?</p>
