After your 3 days and 2 nights in Orlando you head right down the road to the port of Tampa and set sail on the cruise you‚Äôve been selected to receive, you‚Äôre going to love the Margaritaville islander, but instead of just sailing for 4 nights we‚Äôre going to upgrade you with an additional 2 nights so you‚Äôll now have a 7 day, 6 night cruise so you can sail to more destinations.</p>

And then of course, there‚Äôs the 23 miles of white sandy beaches and world-famous boardwalks, and it doesn‚Äôt stop there!!</p>

<p>üõéÔ∏è I do want to mention that although the Ft.Lauderdale/Miami area is one of my favorites. This part of the VIP extended stay is fully customizable. Maybe you want 3 additional nights in Orlando, or take those 3 nights as a separate vacation. It‚Äôs all up to you, it‚Äôs your vacation, and you don‚Äôt have to decide that today.</p>

<p>üéüÔ∏è We also give you $100.00 Universal & Disney Entertainment Voucher that you can use for Theme Parks, Attractions, or evening Dinning while you're on vacation!</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Now Mr./Mrs. __________, this is important. This is an exclusive vacation offer not available to the general public and is offered on a first come, first serve basis because of the discounted price and limited availability.</p>

<p>Obviously I‚Äôm sure you can imagine your VIP extended stay vacation is valued at well over $4,950.

So the total is only $1574 for the extended stay, plus the $396 for the port taxes that you‚Äôve already paid. So your grand total is only $1970 and that includes everything we talked about earlier. The 3 days and 2 nights in Orlando, the upgrade to the 7 day 6 night cruise on the amazing Islander, and the additional 4 days & 3 nights in south Florida that you could even use at another time.

<p>Now you can see why everyone is doing it!!‚úÖ So you‚Äôre already registered for your cruise, now we can add the $1,674 to the same card that you provided for your port tax or would you prefer to use a different card?</p>
