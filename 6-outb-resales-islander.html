<p>💯 I am soooo excited! 📖 Let me tell you how this fabulous vacation unfolds.</p>

<p>While in Orlando you’ll be centrally located to all the major attractions like Disney, Sea World, Universal Studios, city walk for your night time entertainment and it doesn’t stop there.</p>

<p>⚓ Now here’s where it gets exciting. After your 3 days and 2 nights in Orlando you head right down the road to the port of Tampa and set sail on the cruise you’ve been selected to receive, you’re going to love the Margaritaville islander, but instead of just sailing for 4 nights we’re going to upgrade you with an additional 2 nights so you’ll now have a 7 day, 6 night cruise so you can sail to more destinations.</p>

<p>Plus, on board the Islander, you’ll enjoy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jimmy Buffett-inspired restaurants & bars</li>
  <li>Live concerts and comedy shows</li>
  <li>Spa & wellness centers</li>
  <li>Poolside lounging and tropical cocktails</li>
  <li>A Huge State of the Art Casino</li>
  <li>And of course… the legendary Captain’s Dinner</li>
</ul>

<p>🏖️ Now after all your fun and sun on your cruise, we’re not gunna just send you right back home, we’re now going to send you to one of the most famous beaches in Florida, Ft. Lauderdale, for 4 days and 3 nights of GORGEOUS Triple-Diamond resort accommodations at one of our nationally-recognized resorts, all hotel accommodations paid.</p>

<p>🛎️ I do want to mention that although the Ft.Lauderdale/Miami area is one of my favorites. This part of the VIP extended stay is fully customizable. Maybe you want 3 additional nights in Orlando, or take those 3 nights as a separate vacation. It’s all up to you, it’s your vacation, and you don’t have to decide that today.</p>

<p>🎟️ We also give you $100.00 Universal & Disney Entertainment Voucher that you can use for Theme Parks, Attractions, or evening Dinning while you're on vacation!</p>
