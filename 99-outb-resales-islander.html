<p>So to secure your port taxes and fees, which card would you like to use- Visa, MasterCard Discover, or American Express?</p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">IF CUSTOMER SAYS NO READ BELOW:</span></p>

<p>Oh, well it‚Äôs your stateroom you‚Äôre entitled to based on the promotion you entered‚Ä¶. And in that promotion there‚Äôs only 4 left that are allowed in your state to even give away for free, but let me send you this in writing so you can see it‚Ä¶ will that be ok?</p>


<p>Because it‚Äôs a FANTASTIC cruise vacation that you can use anytime you want in the next 18 months for you and any guest you choose.</p>

<p>üéâ I just generated your confirmation code for your free cruise and this is so amazing!!   
  <h2>YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS!</h2></p>
<p> <div class="section">
    In a moment I‚Äôm going to transfer you to our corporate Verification Department, 
    where they‚Äôre actually going to give you your Reservation Number, Email Travel Confirmation 
    as well as your audio receipt.
    <br><br>
  It's been our experience in the travel industry that most people don't want to come all the way down to South Florida just to take a cruise and turn back around.  Most want to
have a little bit more vacation time and really want to enjoy all that Florida has to offer.  
  
<br> 
  So they built a VIP-Extended Stay Vacation Package that's 80% OFF RETAIL, that goes hand in hand with your cruise, and it's for 1st timne cruisers only!
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    I thought we had sold out of them for the State of ________, but we have a few more it seems because since you‚Äôre a 1st Time Cruiser with us the computer is showing me that you‚Äôre eligible for it - which is HUGE news for you because
    we have a very limited number of these packages available and they‚Äôre not available to the general public!
    Literally everyone we speak with takes advantage of it!  
  </div>
<br> I'll tell you what it comes with and if you like it great, if not no worries the cruise is yours regardless! 
  <div class="section">
    Here‚Äôs how the VIP Package unfolds:
    <br><br>
    When you arrive in Florida ________ (customer‚Äôs name) we have a rental car waiting for you at the 
    Alamo rental car agency. The car is yours for the entire Florida vacation, both before and after your 
    cruise to the Bahamas with unlimited mileage.
    <br><br>
    In order to pick up the car you must be at least 21 years of age, and of course have a valid driver‚Äôs license. 
    The only thing you are responsible for with the rental car is gas, and any rental car tax.
    <br><br>
    Now if you would like to have the comforts of your own vehicle, we will reimburse you up to 
    <span class="highlight">$150 in gas</span> or 
    <span class="highlight">$150 in Uber credit!</span>
  </div>


  <div class="section">
    Now, ___________ (cust. name) you‚Äôll start your vacation in sunny Ft. Lauderdale Florida with 
    <span class="highlight">3 days & 2 nights of luxury hotel accommodations</span> at a triple diamond nationally recognized resort ‚Äì like Ramada, Sheraton, or Hilton 
    and you‚Äôll be just 10-15 minutes from the world famous Ft. Lauderdale Beaches.

    <br>Ft. Lauderdale is widely known as the yachting and boating capital of the world. Ft. Lauderdale recently underwent a spectacular 26 million dollar renovation on a new board walk, with all your shops, caf√©‚Äôs, restaurants, and boutiques. 
    <bf></bf>Ft. Lauderdale has 25 miles of beautiful, pristine beaches. At the hotel your only responsible for your room service, any long distance phone calls and of course your hotel taxes. 
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    After that stay in Ft. Lauderdale you, of course, will be boarding the award-winning 
    <span class="highlight">Jimmy Buffet‚Äôs Margaritaville At Sea Cruise ship: The ISLANDER</span>‚Ä¶.
    <br><br>
    And this VIP package turns your 4-night cruise into a 
    <span class="highlight">6 Day / 5 Night Cruise</span> that gives you all the incredible itineraries the Islander has to offer including Key West, Mexico, Jamaica, 
    the Grand Bahamas and more!
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    After the incredible time you‚Äôve had in tropical paradise you‚Äôll then re-board the ship and sail back to Florida, 
    and that‚Äôs the captain‚Äôs dinner for the return passage (which is an amazing dinner).
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    Now that day when you get back from your cruise in Tampa, you get one last piece of FUN before you head back home!  
    When you get back from your cruise you get to head to magical Orlando Florida for 3 days and 2 nights of luxury hotel accommodations!! Have you been to Orlando before? 
  <br><br>
    You know you can‚Äôt come to Florida without shaking Mickey Mouse‚Äôs hand, right! You will be staying just minutes from all the major theme parks such as Disney World, Universal Studios, Epcot Center and more!! 
Also keep in mind every portion of this vacation package is fully transferable to a friend or family member at your discretion and you will have a full 18 months to travel.
