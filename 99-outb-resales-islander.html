<p>Now the only dates NOT available for your FREE CRUISE are December 24th through January 4th but every other day in the year is available.</p>

<p>So <i>__________(Customer's Name)___________</i> here's how things work out for you. Because there's only a few cabins left for your state and due to the $900 value, we are assigning cabins on a first come first serve basis. So in order to secure your cruise and generate a confirmation code, you simply need to secure the government port taxes and fees of only $198 per person for a total of only $396 today.</p>

<p>So to secure your port taxes and fees, which card would you like to use- Visa, MasterCard Discover, or American Express?</p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">IF CUSTOMER SAYS NO READ BELOW:</span></p>

<p>Oh, well it‚Äôs your stateroom you‚Äôre entitled to based on the promotion you entered‚Ä¶. And in that promotion there‚Äôs only 4 left that are allowed in your state to even give away for free, but let me send you this in writing so you can see it‚Ä¶ will that be ok?</p>


<p>Because it‚Äôs a FANTASTIC cruise vacation that you can use anytime you want in the next 18 months for you and any guest you choose.</p>
