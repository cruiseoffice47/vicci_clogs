  <h3>üí≥ Payment</h3>

  <p>Mr./Mrs.___________ in order to secure your free cruise and generate a confirmation code, you will simply need to pay the government port taxes which allows you to leave and reenter the country. This is only $98 per person for a total of only $196 today.</p>
  <p>Which card will you be using Visa, MasterCard or Discover?</p>
 
<span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">‚ùåIF CUSTOMER SAYS NO READ BELOW:</span>

Oh, well it‚Äôs your stateroom you‚Äôre entitled to based on the promotion you entered‚Ä¶. And in that promotion there‚Äôs only 4 left that are allowed in your state to even give away for free, 
  but let me send you this in writing so you can see it‚Ä¶ will that be ok?

  <p>Mr/Mrs __________ I just generated your confirmation code for your free cruise and this is so amazing, you‚Äôre going to love this, the computer randomly selects 10 of the free cruise customer‚Äôs per state to help promote Florida and its number one cruise line to the Bahamas by giving a VIP extended stay vacation at a huge discount, and your confirmation code was one of the 10 chosen for the <i>(customers state)</i>.</p>

I‚Äôm so excited for you!!!</p>

  <h3>üå¥ Extended Stay Vacation</h3>
  <p>Let me tell you how your fabulous vacation unfolds!</p>
  <p>Now when you first get down here you‚Äôll arrive in sunny south Florida which is fort Lauderdale, in fort Lauderdale we start you out with 3 days and 2 nights of gorgeous triple diamond resort accommodations at one of our nationally recognized resorts, all hotel accommodations paid, in Fort Lauderdale you‚Äôll be centrally located to all the activities south Florida has to offer, you know, the world famous shopping dining and nightlife, there‚Äôs 23 miles of white sandy beaches, world famous boardwalks, and it doesn‚Äôt stop there.</p>

  <p>After your 3 days and 2 nights in Ft Lauderdale you‚Äôll drive right down the road to the port of Palm Beach to board the cruise that you‚Äôve been selected to receive, you‚Äôre going to love the Bahamas.</p>

  <p>And to show our appreciation in advance for your great word of mouth advertising, I‚Äôm going to include a $50 casino match play certificate, that basically $50 of free money for you to gamble with in the gorgeous casino. But Mr/mrs __________ If you hit it big, don‚Äôt forget who got you there!! I only want 10% hahahaha just kidding the money is all yours.</p>

  <p>But have you ever visited a tropical island before?</p>
  <p>The reason I ask is because the number one request we get from repeat travelers is that they would like the spend more time on the beach, rather than having just one day on the island, so with your VIP extended stay vacation, this is the best part, you will now have 3 days and 2 night ON THE BEACH AT THE GEORGOUS GRAND LUCAYAN BEACH AND GOLF RESORT AND SPA or The Pelican Bay which are both AAA rated FOUR star resorts right on the beach in the Bahamas, it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous and has been named one of the best destinations in the Caribbean. If you want to check out the resort you can go their website at www.grandlucayan.com or www.pelicanbayhotel.com. Now during your stay there you can go snorkeling, diving, fishing, jet skiing, swimming, or just relax on the most beautiful beach in the world. Plus the resort you‚Äôre staying at is absolutely incredible. And again that‚Äôs 3 days and 2 nights on the beach at the gorgeous Grand Lucayan or Pelican Bay Resort.</p>

  <p>Mr/Mrs________ once you see the beautiful ocean water that is so clear you can see the ocean floor, your going to realize you truly are in paradise. The Bahamas has some of the clearest water and cleanest sandy beaches in the world. This is a memory and a vacation that you will truly never forget and never want to leave.</p>

  <p>Now when you arrive back to Florida from the Bahamas, your vacation gets even better, instead of sending you right back home, we‚Äôre going to send you to the number one tourist destination in the world, Orlando, Florida for an additional 3 day 2 night stay at an official universal studio destination resort. During you‚Äôre stay you‚Äôll be just minutes away from all the major attractions, including Disney, SeaWorld, Universal studios, Island of Adventure, and city walk for your nighttime entertainment. So write that down, that‚Äôs 3 days and 2 nights in Orlando.</p>
