    First let me explain why we're running this very popular free cruise promotion.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reason we're giving away this cruise for free is part of a special promotion for our brand-new ship, The Margaritaville Islander. 
    We want real travelers like you to be among the first to experience everything it has to offer, all we ask is that you share your experience with friends and family so hopefully they want to come travel with us as well. 
    Makes sense right? <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(get a yes)</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    --A--first_name--B-- this promotion is based on a first come first serve basis per state, so what state are you coming from? 
    <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(get customer's state)</span>
  </p>

  <p>How's the weather in the great state of ________</p>

  <p>Well You're going to love coming down to Florida where the weather is gorgeous all year round!!</p>

  <p>
    --A--first_name--B-- Let me put you on a brief hold to check to see if we have any free cruise cabins left for the great state of __________ so hold on for one moment ok?<br>
    <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(Park call for 5-10 seconds and come back on extremely excited)</span>

    Great news! I'm showing we only have 5 free cruise cabins left for the state of __________ and you got one!<br>
    So congratulations again!!!
  </p>

  <p>
    --A--first_name--B-- I'll quickly go over the details of your FREE CRUISE but first I just need to let you know that because of the limited availability of the FREE CRUISE promotion, we will need to know today if you want to take advantage of the offer, even though we give you 18 months to use the cruise, fair enough? 
    <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(get a yes)</span>
  </p>

  <p>ok perfect!</p>

  <p>
    So, you'll be cruising to some AMAZING destinations, with your cabin, all meals, and entertainment included. 
    And like I mentioned, you have a full year and a half to use it — plenty of time to plan the perfect getaway, right?

  It's been our experience in the travel industry that most people don't want to come all the way down to South Florida just to take a cruise and turn back around.  Most want to
have a little bit more vacation time and really want to enjoy all that Florida has to offer.  
  
<br> <br>
  So they built a VIP-Extended Stay Vacation Package that's 80% OFF RETAIL, that goes hand in hand with your cruise, and it's for 1st timne cruisers only!
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    I thought we had sold out of them for the State of ________, but we have a few more it seems because since you’re a 1st Time Cruiser with us the computer is showing me that you’re eligible for it - which is HUGE news for you because
    we have a very limited number of these packages available and they’re not available to the general public!
    Literally everyone we speak with takes advantage of it!  
  </div>
<br> I'll tell you what it comes with and if you like it great, if not no worries the cruise is yours regardless! 
  <div class="section">
    Here’s how the VIP Package unfolds:
    <br><br>
    When you arrive in Florida ________ (customer’s name) we have a rental car waiting for you at the 
    Alamo rental car agency. The car is yours for the entire Florida vacation, both before and after your 
    cruise to the Bahamas with unlimited mileage.
    <br><br>
    Now if you would like to have the comforts of your own vehicle, you get $150 dollars in gas reimbursement or $150 dollars in Uber or Lyft credits!  Which is pretty cool!

  </div>
<br><br>
    Now, ___________ (cust. name) you’ll start your vacation in sunny Ft. Lauderdale Florida with 
    <span class="highlight">3 days & 2 nights of luxury hotel accommodations</span> at a triple diamond nationally recognized resort – like Ramada, Sheraton, or Hilton, all hotel accommodations paid,  
    and you’ll be just 10-15 minutes from the world famous Ft. Lauderdale Beaches.
Ft. Lauderdale is widely known as the yachting and boating capital of the world. Ft. Lauderdale recently underwent a spectacular 26 million dollar renovation on a new board walk, with all your shops, café’s, restaurants, and boutiques. 
    <bf></bf>Ft. Lauderdale has 25 miles of beautiful, pristine beaches. 
  </div>
<br><br>
  <div class="section">
    After that stay in Ft. Lauderdale you, of course, will be boarding the award-winning 
    <span class="highlight">Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville At Sea Cruise ship: The ISLANDER</span>….
    <br><br>
    And this VIP package turns your 4-night cruise into a 
    <span class="highlight">6 Day / 5 Night Cruise</span> that gives you all the incredible itineraries the Islander has to offer including Key West, Mexico, Jamaica, 
    the Grand Bahamas and more!
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    After the incredible time you’ve had in tropical paradise you’ll then re-board the ship and sail back to Florida, 
    and that’s the captain’s dinner for the return passage (which is an amazing dinner).
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <br><br>
    Now that day when you get back from your cruise in Tampa, you get one last piece of FUN before you head back home!  
    When you get back from your cruise you get to head to magical Orlando Florida for 3 days and 2 nights of luxury hotel accommodations!! Have you been to Orlando before? 
  <br><br>
    You know you can’t come to Florida without shaking Mickey Mouse’s hand, right! You will be staying just minutes from all the major theme parks such as Disney World, Universal Studios, Epcot Center and more!! 
Also keep in mind every portion of this vacation package is fully transferable to a friend or family member at your discretion and you will have a full 18 months to travel.
