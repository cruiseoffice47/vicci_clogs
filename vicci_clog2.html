First let me explain why we're running this very popular free cruise promotion.

The reason we're giving away this cruise for free is part of a special promotion for our brand-new ship, The Margaritaville Islander. We want real travelers like you to be among the first to experience everything it has to offer, all we ask is that you share your experience with friends and family so hopefully they want to come travel with us as well. Makes sense right? <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(get a yes)</span>

--A--first_name--B-- this promotion is based on a first come first serve basis per state, so what state are you coming from? <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(get customer's state)</span>

How's the weather in the great state of ________

Well You're going to love coming down to Florida where the weather is gorgeous all year round!!

--A--first_name--B-- Let me put you on a brief hold to check to see if we have any free cruise cabins left for the great state of __________ so hold on for one moment ok?
<span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(Park call for 5-10 seconds and come back on extremely excited)</span>

Great news! I'm showing we only have 5 free cruise cabins left for the state of __________ and you got one!

So congratulations again!!!


--A--first_name--B-- I'll quickly go over the details of your FREE CRUISE but first I just need to let you know that because of the limited availability of the FREE CRUISE promotion, we will need to know today if you want to take advantage of the offer, even though we give you 18 months to use the cruise, fair enough? <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(get a yes)</span>

ok perfect!

So, you'll be cruising to some AMAZING destinations, with your cabin, all meals, and entertainment included. And like I mentioned, you have a full year and a half to use it — plenty of time to plan the perfect getaway, right?
<span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(get a yes)</span>

--A--first_name--B-- your FREE CRUISE is for a minimum of 2, but can accommodate up to 4.

So --A--first_name--B-- are you excited?

Well get excited, you're going on a 4 night cruise!!!

When's the last time you even took a vacation?  <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(Get the customer's in the travel mindset)</span>

So let me quickly go over all the details and we'll get you registered for your FREE CRUISE!

On board the ship, you'll have your own private inside stateroom with a crew member assigned to your room for any and all your personal needs.  And all we ask is for a 30 to 60 day notice prior to you wanting to set sail that's all, ok?

After your 4 exciting days at sea, you'll reboard the ship and enjoy the exciting captains dinner for your return passage to beautiful Tampa Bay.

Now the only dates NOT available for your FREE CRUISE are December 24th through January 4th but every other day in the year is available.

So --A--first_name--B-- here's how things work out for you. Because there's only a few cabins left for your state and due to the $900 value, we are assigning cabin on a first come first serve basis.

So to secure your port taxes and fees, which card would you like to use- Visa, MasterCard Discover, or American Express?

I just generated your confirmation code for your free cruise and this is so amazing!!  You’re going to love this. 

 

The computer randomly selects 10 of the free cruise customers per state to help promote Florida and its newest cruise line by giving a VIP extended stay vacation at a HUGE discount!! 

Your confirmation number was one of the 10 chosen for (Customer’s state)! 

Congratulations! 

Please keep in mind that this is available only for (Customer State) residents that are VIP 1st time cruisers because we know as soon as you set sail, you’re not going to want your vacation to end!  We know you want to have a fantastic time! 

I am soooo excited! 

Let me tell you how this fabulous vacation unfolds. 

(Customer’s name) when you get down here we aren’t going to just let you try and figure out where everything is on your own so we are going to invite you to our VIP welcome center where they will give you lots of information on area attractions, great dining places and directions so you will know where everything is and what there is to do in order to make your stay more enjoyable. 

First when you arrive down here to go on your cruise, you’ll arrive in Orlando.  In Orlando we we give you 3 days and 2 night of gorgeous triple diamond resort accommodations at one of our nationally recognized resorts, all hotel accommodations paid.  

While in Orlando you’ll be centrally located to all the major attractions like Disney, Sea World, Universal Studios, city walk for your night time entertainment and it doesn’t stop there. 

Now here’s where it gets exciting.  After your 3 days and 2 nights in Orlando you head right down the road to the port of Tampa and set sail on the cruise you’ve been selected to receive, you’re going to love the Margaritaville islander, but instead of just sailing for 4 nights we’re going to upgrade you with an additional 2 nights so you’ll now have a 7 day, 6 night cruise so you can sail to more destinations.  
Plus, on board the Islander, you’ll enjoy: 

• Jimmy Buffett-inspired restaurants & bars 

• Live concerts and comedy shows 

• Spa & wellness centers 

• Poolside lounging and tropical cocktails 

• Casino action 

• And of course… the legendary Captain’s Dinner
Now after all your fun and sun on your cruise, we’re not gunna just send you right back home, we’re now going to send you to one of the most famous beaches in Florida, Ft. Lauderdale, for 4 days and 3 nights of GORGEOUS Triple-Diamond resort accommodations at one of our nationally-recognized resorts, all hotel accommodations paid. 

While in Fort Lauderdale, you’ll be centrally-located to all the activities South Florida has to offer; you know, the world-famous SHOPPING, DINING, and NIGHTLIFE. And then of course, there’s the 23 miles of white sandy beaches and world-famous boardwalks, and it doesn’t stop there!! 

I do want to mention that although the Ft.Lauderdale/Miami area is one of my favorites.  This part of the VIP extended stay is fully customizable.  Maybe you want 3 additional nights in Orlando, or take those 3 nights as a separate vacation.  It’s all up to you, it’s your vacation, and you don’t have to decide that today. 

We also give you $100.00 Universal & Disney Entertainment Voucher that you can use for Theme Parks, Attractions, or evening Dinning while you're on vacation!

GREAT! 

Also, with the Extended Stay Vacation Package you will be a VIP with Margaritaville At Sea - which means you can travel at any time of the year! 

 

Now Mr./Mrs.______________________, this is important. This is an exclusive vacation offer not available to the general public and is offered on a first come, first serve basis because of the discounted price and limited availability. 

Now (Customer’s name) I’m sure you can imagine your VIP extended stay vacation is valued at well over $4,950. However, in exchange for helping us with some good old-fashioned word-of-mouth advertising and touring one of our developer’s fine vacation resorts, you are now approved for the VIP “Extended-Stay” vacation. 

Now (Customer’s name) I can now add all of this Florida vacation excitement to your cruise for only $787 per person.  So the total is only $1574 for the extended stay, plus the $396 for the port taxes that you’ve already paid.  So your grand total is only $1970 and that includes everything we talked about earlier.  The 3 days and 2 nights in Orlando, the upgrade to the 7 day 6 night cruise on the amazing Islander, and the additional 4 days a 3 nights is south florida that you could even use at another time.  Oh yeah, let’s not forget about the $100 entertainment voucher. 

It’s amazing how good of a deal you can get directly from the owner of the cruise line. And we give you 18 months to use the vacation. 

  

Now you can see why everyone is doing it!! 

  

So you’re already registered for your cruise, now we can add the $1,674 to the same card that you provided for your port tax or would you prefer to use a different card?
