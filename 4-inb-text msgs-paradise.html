<p>üö¢ Our new ship sets sail 3 times per week, whether it's half full, part full, or completely full.... and an empty cabin can't spend money in the gift shop or casino, so we want to fill those unused cabins... But also what's the first thing you would do when you get back home from your cruise, other than unpack? <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(Let them answer)</span></p>

<p>Exactly! You'd tell your friends and family all about us And then they would want to travel with us as well!</p>

<p>üì¢ Positive word-of-mouth Advertising is the best form of advertising out there...you'd agree with that right? <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(get a yes)</span></p>

<p>Exactly!</p>

They have beautiful historical sites, tax and duty free shopping, and horseback riding on the beach. You can swim, try a glass bottom boat ride, or just relax on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. You might want to try our newest and most popular attraction, the dolphin experience, where you actually swim with the dolphins. But it‚Äôs all up to you, you‚Äôre in paradise.</p>

<p>üçΩÔ∏è Then after all the fun and sun in the Bahamas, you‚Äôll reboard the cruise ship and enjoy the exciting captain‚Äôs dinner for your return passage to sunny Florida.</p>

<p>Now, Mr./Mrs._________ here‚Äôs how things will work out for you. Because there is limited free cruise cabins left, and due to the $600 value, we are assigning cabins on a first come first serve basis.</p>

<p>Mr./Mrs.___________ in order to secure your free cruise and generate a confirmation code, you will simply need to pay the government port taxes which allows you to leave and reenter the country. This is only $98 per person for a total of only $196 today.</p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">So to secure your port taxes and fees, which card would you like to use- Visa, MasterCard Discover, or American Express?</span></p>

<p>Oh, well it‚Äôs your stateroom you‚Äôre entitled to based on the promotion you entered‚Ä¶. And either that promotion there‚Äôs only 4 left that are allowed in your state to even give away for free, but let me send you this in writing so you can see it‚Ä¶ will that be ok?</p>

<p>Because it‚Äôs a FANTASTIC cruise vacation that you can use anytime you want in the next 18 months for you and any guest you choose.</p>

<p>Can I verify your email really quick?</p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(IF YES)</span></p>

<p>From everyone here with Margaritaville at sea, I'd like to be the first to say "WELCOME ABOARD!"</p>

<p>üí≥ The total cost of your government port taxes are ONE HUNDRED AND NINTY SIX dollars and that is charged today and will show up on your next billing statement, please hold while I generate your confirmation code. Thank you.</p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(Put customer on hold so we can process the deal)</span></p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(Get back on the phone with crazy excitement and start reading. Smile for the money)</span></p>

<p>Mr/Mrs __________ I just generated your confirmation code for your free cruise and this is so amazing, you‚Äôre going to love this, the computer randomly selects 10 of the free cruise customer‚Äôs per state to help promote Florida and its number one cruise line to the Bahamas by giving a VIP extended stay vacation at a huge discount, and your confirmation code was one of the 10 chosen for the <i>(Customer‚Äôs State)</i>.</p>

<p>We know as soon as you get to the Bahamas you‚Äôre not going to want to leave, So we‚Äôve partnered up with different resorts, rental car agencies and attractions to make sure you have a truly unforgettable vacation! Congratulations.</p>

<p>üìç Now when you first get down here, we‚Äôre not going to let you go find out where everything is on your own, we‚Äôll first invite you to our VIP welcome center where we have lots of information on area attractions, dining, nightlife, and a variety of other things to do so we can show you everything that the amazing state of Florida has to offer and make sure you have the best possible vacation! I‚Äôm so excited for you!!!</p>

<p>Let me tell you how your fabulous vacation unfolds!</p>

<p>Now when you first get down here you‚Äôll arrive in sunny south Florida which is Fort Lauderdale. In Fort Lauderdale we start you out with 3 days and 2 nights of gorgeous triple diamond resort accommodations at one of our nationally recognized resorts, all hotel accommodations paid. In Fort Lauderdale you‚Äôll be centrally located to all the activities South Florida has to offer, you know, the world famous shopping, dining and nightlife, there‚Äôs 23 miles of white sandy beaches, world famous boardwalks, and it doesn‚Äôt stop there.</p>

<p>After your 3 days and 2 nights in Ft Lauderdale you‚Äôll drive right down the road to the port of Palm Beach to board the cruise that you‚Äôve been selected to receive, you‚Äôre going to love the Bahamas.</p>

<p>üé≤ And to show our appreciation in advance for your great word of mouth advertising, I‚Äôm going to include a $50 casino match play certificate, that‚Äôs basically $50 of free money for you to gamble with in the gorgeous casino. But Mr/Mrs __________ If you hit it big, don‚Äôt forget who got you there!! I only want 10% hahahaha just kidding the money is all yours.</p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">But have you ever visited a tropical island before?</span></p>

<p>The reason I ask is because the number one request we get from repeat travelers is that they would like the spend more time on the beach, rather than having just one day on the island, so with your VIP extended stay vacation, this is the best part, you will now have 3 days and 2 night ON THE BEACH AT THE GEORGOUS GRAND LUCAYAN BEACH AND GOLF RESORT AND SPA or The Pelican Bay which are both AAA rated FOUR star resorts right on the beach in the Bahamas, it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous and has been named one of the best destinations in the Caribbean. If you want to check out the resort you can go their website at www.grandlucayan.com or www.pelicanbayhotel.com.</p>

<p>Now during your stay there you can go snorkeling, diving, fishing, jet skiing, swimming, or just relax on the most beautiful beach in the world. Plus the resort you‚Äôre staying at is absolutely incredible. And again that‚Äôs 3 days and 2 nights on the beach at the gorgeous Grand Lucayan or Pelican Bay Resort.</p>

<p>Mr/Mrs________ once you see the beautiful ocean water that is so clear you can see the ocean floor, your going to realize you truly are in paradise. The Bahamas has some of the clearest water and cleanest sandy beaches in the world. This is a memory and a vacation that you will truly never forget and never want to leave.</p>

<p>Now when you arrive back to Florida from the Bahamas, your vacation gets even better, instead of sending you right back home, we‚Äôre going to send you to the number one tourist destination in the world, Orlando, Florida for an additional 3 day 2 night stay at an official universal studio destination resort. During your stay you‚Äôll be just minutes away from all the major attractions, including Disney, SeaWorld, Universal studios, Island of Adventure, and city walk for your nighttime entertainment. So write that down, that‚Äôs 3 days and 2 nights in Orlando.</p>

<p>MR/Mrs _________ , All that we ask is you keep in mind that this vacation is NOT available to the general public. You were randomly selected to receive this amazing promotion and they are VERY VERY limited.</p>

<p>With that being said, your VIP vacation includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3 days and 2 nights in sunny south Florida (Ft. Lauderdale) before your cruise</li>
  <li>Your 2 day 2 night cruise to the Bahamas with all meals included</li>
  <li>Your 3 days and 2 nights at the gorgeous GRAND LUCAYAN BEACH AND GOLF RESORT AND SPA</li>
  <li>Your 3 days and 2 nights in Orlando near all the major attractions</li>
</ul>

<p>And again we put this vacation together for you to have a great time and tell your friends and family all about us when you get back home which you could do for us right? <span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">(Get a yes)</span></p>

<p>Also with your extended stay vacation, you‚Äôre a VIP with the MARGARITAVILLE PARADISE, so you can travel any time of year.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Now Mr/Mrs ________ this is important, cause this is an exclusive vacation offer that‚Äôs not available to the general public and is offered on a first come first serve basis because of the discounted price and limited availability.</p>

<p>Now Mr/Mrs________ I‚Äôm sure you can imagine that your VIP extended stay vacation is valued at well over 3,950 Dollars, however, in exchange for helping us with some good old fashioned word of mouth advertising, touring one of our developers fine vacation resorts, and because you participated in the free cruise promotion, you‚Äôre now approved for the VIP extended stay vacation.</p>

<p>After I apply this amazing discount that you‚Äôve been selected to receive, I can add all this vacation excitement to your cruise for only an additional $736 per person, so the total is only an additional $1472 for the extended stay, plus the $198 for the port taxes that you already paid, so your grand total is only $1670, and that includes everything we talked about earlier, your 3 days and 2 nights in Orlando, your 3 days and 2 nights in Ft Lauderdale, your 3 days and 2 nights on the beach in the beautiful Bahamas.</p>

<p>And this is all in addition to your cruise to the Bahamas with all your food and entertainment included! Sounds great, right?</p>

<p>üí≥ It‚Äôs amazing how good a deal you can get directly from the owner of the cruise line and again we give you 18 months to use the vacation. So you can see why everyone‚Äôs doing it!</p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">So would you like to add the $1494 to the same card you provided for the port taxes or would you like to use a different card?</span></p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">IF CUSTOMER SAYS NO READ BELOW</span></p>

<p>No worries, it‚Äôs just most people we speak with don‚Äôt want to come all the way down to sunny south Florida just to take a 2 night cruise and go right back home. Everyone we speak to wants to get down here a night or 2 before just to make sure they‚Äôre on time and usually stay a night or two after to enjoy everything Florida has to offer, you‚Äôd agree with that right?</p>

<p>We‚Äôve partnered up with all these resorts and ride sharing agencies to make sure you have everything you‚Äôll want and need to make this a fabulous vacation, plus you only live once, go have fun and make some memories on vacation.</p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">But let me ask, if you had to name one thing about the extended stay vacation you loved the most what would it be?</span></p>

<p><span style="background:yellow; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Ok well let me do this, let me ask my supervisor a question real quick cause maybe there's something he can do, because I really want you to have a fabulous vacation. Hold on one moment, I‚Äôll be right back with you, okay?</span></p>
